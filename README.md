# path_finder

This project designs, implements and demonstrates an algorithm which takes any input map 
(similar to the map below) and, starting at a given source point, finds a short path to a given
destination point, without passing through any building shapes. The objective is to do this while 
minimising the overall travel distance and using a computationally efficient algorithm.
